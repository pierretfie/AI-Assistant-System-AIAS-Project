# Overview
**AIAS** (AI Assistant Systems) is a research initiative built on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs).  
The vision behind AIAS is to create AI collaborators capable of performing repetitive and assistant-like tasks, with the potential to evolve into highly interactive, autonomous systems.  

At its core, the project features **Rena**, an AI system currently designed for chat- and audio-based interactions. Over time, Rena is envisioned to grow beyond conversational automation and into a humanoid form capable of physical interaction and movement.  

A defining aspect of AIAS is that each system is designed to **develop and remember its own personality**, making every instance unique, human-like, and partially self-aware. Integrating human traits such as emotional intelligence (EQ) has proven to enhance natural interaction. While replicating true feelings is challenging, simulating emotions has shown to significantly improve the user experience.  

# Inspiration
Science fiction has long shaped how we imagine AI, and with modern computing power, many of those ideas are becoming feasible.  
This project draws inspiration from fictional AI assistants such as **Jarvis** (*Iron Man*) and **Gideon** (*The Flash*).  

# Goal
To build a community of AIAS systems with a degree of awareness and independence, enabling seamless and natural human-AI collaboration.  

# Assistant-like Capabilities
* Manage calendar events and reminders  
* Handle emails  
* Organize notes  
* Manage YouTube and social media platforms  
* Automate web browsers: play music, stream videos, and navigate websites  
* Control embedded systems such as lights and other IoT devices  

# Working Environment
The current version of AIAS uses **n8n workflows** and a **Linux** host acting as server to coordinate and perform these tasks.  
The workflows use NGROK for web requests and hooking.

* n8n - Agent, Models, Tools
* NGROK

# Project Scope
AIAS systems can be integrated into diverse environments and applications: homes, offices, vehicles, waiting areas, receptions, navigation guides, security operations, and more.  

As development progresses, the project is also exploring **security risks and safeguards**, given the sensitivity of granting AI systems access to digital environments and devices.
